Hi Isabel,

That is what I tried before - I had a lot of trouble with the jar file and decided it wasn't going to be worth trying to solve that for me, 
then also for the end-user on a mac.   Interesting that you found it easier.

I've attached the andor drivers I have - it does look like they're only for windows. Also the code I use to run them - 
I don't use the m files they provide, but call the mex functions directly.  See the "msif_loadframes"  and  "msif_getnumframes"  
subfunctions in VideoFileReadRoutines.  Not the most efficient code with multiple file initialisations, but we've never had to do 
heavy duty file input on sif files so it's never been an issue.
